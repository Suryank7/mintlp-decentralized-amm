# 🎙️ Hackathon Presentation Script: MintLP
**Time Limit**: ~3 Minutes
**Tone**: Confident, Energetic, Visionary

### 1. The Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
**"Good morning judges and fellow builders. Liquidity is the lifeblood of DeFi, but providing it feels like throwing money into a black hole."**

"You deposit tokens, you get a generic ERC-20 receipt, and then... you're blind. You don't know your real-time fees. You don't see your impermanent loss until it's too late. It’s opaque, impersonal, and outdated. Today, we're changing that."

### 2. The Solution (0:30 - 1:00)
**"Introducing MintLP: The first Decentralized AMM where every Liquidity Position is a dynamic, living NFT."**

"We don't just give you a receipt. We mint you a digital asset.
*   Your position is an **NFT**.
*   Your fees are attached to that **NFT**.
*   Your history is tracked in that **NFT**.

We've built a dual-engine AMM that handles both volatile tokens (using Constant Product) and stablecoins (using StableSwap) with enterprise-grade precision."

### 3. The Demo (1:00 - 2:30)
*(Navigate to Swap Page)*
**"Let's look at the engine."**
"Here on our Swap interface, notice the **Glassmorphism UI**—we prioritize design because DeFi shouldn't look like a spreadsheet. I'm swapping SUI for USDC.
*   The system instantly calculates the optimal route.
*   See that 'Price Impact' warning? That's our safety guardrail preventing bad trades."

*(Navigate to Liquidity -> Add Liquidity)*
**"Now, let's provide liquidity."**
"I'll choose the SUI-USDC pool. I enter my amounts, and watch this... **MINT**.
I didn't just 'deposit'. I created a unique position."

*(Navigate to Positions Page)*
**"This is the magic moment."**
"Here in my Portfolio, I see my **NFT Card**.
*   It shows my exact pool share.
*   It tracks my fees earning in real-time.
*   It even calculates my impermanent loss live.
I can claim my fees directly into my wallet without withdrawing my liquidity. This is total visibility."

### 4. Technical Excellence (2:30 - 2:45)
**"Under the hood?"**
"We're running a custom TypeScript math engine using BigInt for zero-precision loss. We support dynamic fee tiers (0.05% for stable, 0.3% for standard) and we've architected this for seamless migration to SUI Move contracts."

### 5. Closing (2:45 - 3:00)
**"MintLP isn't just an exchange.** It's a portfolio management tool for the modern liquidity provider. We are bringing transparency, efficiency, and beauty to DeFi."

**"We are Team Duality. Thank you."**
